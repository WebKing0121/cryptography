Welcome to ``cryptography``
===========================

.. warning::

    ``cryptography`` is very young, and very incomplete.

``cryptography`` is a Python library which exposes cryptographic primitives and
recipes.

Why a new crypto library for Python?
------------------------------------

We wanted to address a few issues with existing cryptography libraries in
Python:

* Lack of PyPy support
* Lack of maintenance
* Use poor implementations of algorithms (i.e. ones with known side-channel
  attacks)
* Lack of high level, "Cryptography for humans", APIs
