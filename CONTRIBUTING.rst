This repository has a mandatory code review policy. Contributions
should happen through pull requests. Never commit to ``master``
directly.

When in doubt, refer to PEP 8 for Python code.

Write docstrings like this::

  def some_function(some_arg):
      """
      Does some things.

      :param some_arg: Some argument.
      """

So, specifically:

- Always use three double quotes.
- Put the three double quotes on their own line.
- No blank line at the end.
- Use Sphinx parameter/attribute documentation syntax.
