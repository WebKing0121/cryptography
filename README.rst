``cryptography`` is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and
recipes to Python developers.

It is currently in early development and isn't recommended for general usage
yet. It targets Python 2.6-2.7, Python 3.2+, as well as PyPy.

Why a new crypto library for Python?
------------------------------------

None of the existing ones work on PyPy, and many of them are unmaintained or
are based around very poor implementations of algorithms (i.e ones with known
side-channel attacks).
